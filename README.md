# GhostStroke
GhostStroke is a RubberDucky project that demonstrates how a DigiSpark (ATtiny85) can emulate a USB keyboard (HID device).
When plugged in, the device automatically launches the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and types whoami (we can insert a fork bomb or a payload to down the system).
